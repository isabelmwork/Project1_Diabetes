### How does change in insulin price compare to change in GDP? 
As GDP per capita increases, the price of insulin increases. There is a strong, positive correlation meaning insulin prices rise when GDP increases and this not due to random chance. Our analysis shows there is a strong relationship, however, it is to be considered there might be a third variable that influences both GDP and insulin price like time/inflation, war, demand, covid, etc.
### How does California diabetes prevalence change overtime? 
There has been a 1.2 % increase in California residents being diagnosed with diabetes between 2012 and 2018. In 2012, there were 3,499,812 residents with diabetes and 5 years later in 2018 there were 4,113,933 people with diabetes. This is 614,121 more people with diabetes. The data percentages already take into account the changes in population each year.
### Does a particular race have more diabetes cases (in California)?
From 2014 to 2018 there was a significant change in the amount of African-Americans with type 2 diabetes compared to other races. From 42 percent down to 29 percent. Not only African-Americans, but Asian-Americans had a wave of diabetes getting from 28 percent of the population down to a low 13 percent, and then back up to 20 percent. Based on the trend it seems like each race has almost hit equal levels of diabetes. In California there are numerous programs such as the "Diabetes Prevention Porgram" that encourages lifestyle changes to Medi-Cal patients to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.
### Is California an outlier (compared to other states)?
According to the data from 2015-2020, population dead by diabetes has a strong linear correlation with population, median household income, population employed, and population in poverty.
Population in poverty and population dead by diabetes have a negative correlation, while the other variables have a positive correlation with population dead by diabetes.
One may not expect that median household income and population dead by diabetes would have a positive correlation. However, this may be due to the fact that median household income is increasing in CA (see graph of Year vs Median Household Income). Similarly, one may not expect for population employed to be positively correlate as well. Though this may be caused by the fact that the population employed is increasing (see graph of Year vs Population Employed (%)).
### Does diabetes death correlated with poverty/GDP/population, employment? 
NOTE: some states are missing (ex: Alaska) bc they don't have weekly diabetes deaths data
We see a similar situation as in CA, except this time average population and average population dead by diabetes are negatively correlated. The linear correlation are also less strong than in CA.
In an effort to understand why the data isn't showing what we expect, we will use the entirety of the data instead of averaging it.
In all of these graphs there is a collection of points that are far away from the rest. In each case these points represent Puerto Rico. We will remove these points, and just look at the mainland USA.
When looking at the entirety of the data the results are different. Not only are the correlations less strong, but population dead by diabetes is now negatively correlated with median household income and population employed.
